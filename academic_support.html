        <p>The UMSI <a href="https://www.si.umich.edu/student-experience/academic-success/about-academic-programs-and-student-life-team">Academic Programs and Student Life</a> (APSL) team’s mission is to empower students to think broadly about their education and to create meaningful academic plans and student experiences that will prepare them to reach their personal and professional goals. Academic advisors challenge and support students to become self-directed learners, informed decision makers and engaged members of the UMSI community and beyond. This is achieved in practice through individual conversations, group advising and other programs/resources (e.g., Canvas/Coursera sites, academic planning guides, faculty talks).</p> 
        <p>The APSL Academic Advising team supports our residential academic programs at UMSI including students in the Bachelor of Science in Information, Master of Health Informatics and Master of Science in Information. The Online Programs Academic Advising team supports our online learners in the Master of Applied Data Science program. Both academic advising teams support our students through scheduled appointments via a scheduling system, regularly scheduled drop-in advising appointments and events which support students’ academic planning. We also offer academic support via online systems used within UMSI such as email, Slack, and Canvas/Coursera announcements.</p>
        <p><strong>For more information, access to academic planning resources and to contact an academic advisor, current students should refer to their program-specific academic advising site. You must be logged into the UMICH Google Suite to access the advising sites.</strong></p>
